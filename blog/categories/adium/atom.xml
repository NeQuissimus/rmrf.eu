    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week I wanted to look for something in my Adium logs (they call them transcripts). I even knew who had sent me the advice, so I selected the person from my contacts and started typing into the search box.
What happened? Absolutely nothing!</p>

<p>I found that my search index had been corrupted. But where do you find Adium’s transcript search index?
Doing this in Terminal helped me and Adium immediately began creating a new index:</p>

<p><code>rm ~/Library/Caches/Adium/Default/*</code></p>

<p>This deletes your old index (and cached images) which Adium immediately recognizes.
After about three seconds (9 MB in 572 log files for me) Adium will have created a new index which should work smoothly.</p>

<p><em>Edit:</em><br/>
The guys from Adium just sent me this wiki article:
<a href="http://trac.adium.im/wiki/BrokenTranscriptSearch">http://trac.adium.im/wiki/BrokenTranscriptSearch</a>
It describes the exact files that will need to be deleted in Adium 1.3 (I just threw out the entire contents of the folder – e.g. avatars would have to be reloaded) and a command that takes care of this process in 1.4 and later.</p>
